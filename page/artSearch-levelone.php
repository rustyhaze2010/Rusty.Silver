<h3>Hello, My name is Jae.</h3>
    
I grew up in the great state of Iowa. A state known for its golden fields of corn in the fall and its small towns where you welcomed with warm smiles. Iowa is full of creative people that are always willing to lend a hand to any one in need. It is the kindness of Iowa residents that will get you. That is why I love Iowa. Not to mention that I have spent most of my life here.
This site will include posts of my life at UNI and Kirkwood CC. Including brief descriptions and stories that I have written. One of these stories that I write about is Alex's Story, it is a story about grieving and life in general. 


 

<h3>When I was younger.</h3>

At a young age my family and I had to take every positive chance we could get. My father was followed jobs where they lead him. It taught me that I have to push yourself to get what you want out of life.
One of my earliest memories was moving to school in a small town called Iowa Falls. I was always excited to see friends at school. To fill the gap in my life was my brother and sister. Each of which I have always loved. They started school right after me. This was about the time that I was learning ride a bike. Which I found to be challenging. My bike was a point of pride. It was a red Huffy and I thought it was the coolest thing.
My family would live in Iowa Falls until I was in the fifth grade. At which time my father's job would pull him to Chariton Iowa. As a Bakery Manager. Another challenging time for me in that I would have to make friends all over again. Working at Hy-vee would make the money I would use to buy my first car. At times I would miss on handing in homework. That was why I would be grateful when it was over. I would go on to graduate high school. The day after graduation I would have to start packing to move again. We were moving to Cedar Rapids. I was going to a local college.


    
<h3>Kirkwood</h3>
As a graduate of Kirkwood Community College. I earned two degrees from KCC; A.A. Liberal Arts and A.A.S. in Graphic Communication Technology.  
I loved to take drawing classes, they could consume me. I always found art related classes to be easy, but when I was working on my liberal art degree that was much tougher for me. I really was not a great planner but I thought things would fall into place during college but over time things seemed to get more challenging than that. My time spent at Kirkwood would be remembered later as the best money I spent to go to college. I do like a challenge, which seems to have became my motto.



<h3>Walt Disney World CP</h3>

As an internship through Kirkwood, I spent six months working at Epcot. Serving food  I would be introduced to a lot of new ideas. Number one was you had to work hard to be creative or you just fall behind. I really love my time there, the weather was great and I meet a lot of new friends that had a lot of the same interests. I enjoyed it there they let me do things I probably never do again in my life time. When I was ready to move back to Iowa it made me feel glade to be home.
Things got better the longer that I was there though. I drove down there and my truck broke down when I got there. When it was getting towed it was hit by lightning.
I moved in with stangers and made a few friends at the park and at the apartment complex. 





<h3>University of Northern Iowa</h3>
I loved to take drawing classes, they could consume me. I always found art related classes to be easy, but when I was working on my liberal art degree that was much tougher for me. I really was not a great planner but I thought things would fall into place during college but over time things seemed to get more challenging than that. My time spent at Kirkwood would be remembered later as the best money I spent to go to college. I do like a challenge, which seems to have became my motto.
